# Data Structures in multiple languages

In order to brush up on my algorithms/data structures and learn some more about cool new languages, I will be creating "libraries" encapsulating each different data structures in multiple languages.

## Languages Supported

- Python (Jypter Notebook, Conceptual + Implementation)
- Rust
- Go
- Haskell

## Data Structures/Algorithms

Below are a list of Data Structures/Algorithms that I plan to implement/conceptually note.
Completed ones will be marked with a âœ”.

### Core

- Linked List - Singly, Doubly, Circular

### Stacks/Queues

- Stack
- Queue
- Deque/ Double-Ended Queue
- Priority Queue (Heap - min-heap / max-heap)
- Monotonic Stack/Queue (sliding window)

### Hashing

- Hash Table/Hash Map
- Hash Set

### Trees

- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- AVL Tree (conceptual only)
- Red-Black Tree (conceptual only)
- Segment Tree (w/ Lazy Propagation)
- Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree)
- Trie (Prefix Tree)
- N-ary Tree
- Heap (Binary Heap)

### Graph Structures

- Adjancency List
- Adjancency Matrix
- Edge List

### Misc

- Disjoint Set (Union-Find/DSU)
- Bloom Filter (conceptual only)
- Skip List (conceptual only)
- LRU/LFU Cache (w/ HashMap + LinkedList/Heap)
